// What CI actually proves, per target.
//
// `scripts/targets.mjs` already reads which platforms exist and which five are
// run, and the why page prints them as a list of triples. A list of triples is
// the weakest form of the claim: "supports the platform" is what everyone
// says, and what nobody's CI checks. The workflow checks it in three different
// senses, and they are not the same sense:
//
//   1. TYPE-CHECKED. The library's `src/lib_c` and `src/crystal/system` for
//      that platform compile. Catches a declaration that went missing.
//   2. AUDITED. An iyi program is cross-compiled for it and the object is read
//      for what it asks the machine for. Catches a call nothing supplies,
//      which is how `__multi3` went missing on wasm32 and arm: a target that
//      type-checks can still emit one.
//   3. RUN. The object is linked and executed somewhere that is that platform,
//      and what it prints is compared with what the same program printed on
//      the machine that built it.
//
// Three of the nine reach (3). Saying so with the jobs named is the difference
// between a portability claim and a portability table, so this script reads
// the jobs rather than letting a page assert them.
//
// HOW IT READS THEM. Both loops are found by their step's own name, and the
// target list inside each is read from the `for target in ...` line with its
// continuations. The cross-compiles are found as literal `--target <triple>`
// occurrences, attributed to the job and step they sit in. The jobs that run
// what was cross-compiled are found by their `needs:` naming the job that
// produced the objects - the dependency edge is the fact, and a job that stops
// needing those objects stops being evidence here.
//
// THE GATE. The nine targets this script finds in the type-check loop have to
// be the nine `src/generated/targets.json` already publishes. Two scripts read
// one workflow; if they disagree, one of them is reading a loop that moved,
// and the site will not publish either reading until they agree.
