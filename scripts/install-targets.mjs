// Which tarballs a release publishes, and what they are called, read out of the
// script that downloads them.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. `src/lib/release.ts` carried the published
// targets as a literal array of two pairs and built each asset URL by
// concatenating strings around the recorded version. Two failures were waiting
// in that. A third published tarball would appear nowhere on this site, because
// nothing in the build reads the set. A renamed asset - `iyi-$version-$target`
// becoming anything else - would make every download link on the site a 404,
// and the build would go on passing: `scripts/no-transcription.mjs` looks for a
// decimal against a time or size unit, and a target name, a file name and a URL
// carry none of the three.
//
// `install.sh` is the authority because it is the thing that downloads them. It
// refuses `$os-$arch` by name, so the set it accepts IS the set a release ships
// for; its `asset=` line is the name it asks the release for, and its `base=`
// line is where it asks. A page that builds the same URL from the same two
// strings cannot point somewhere the installer does not.
//
// FOUR READINGS, and the disagreement of any two is a build failure.
//
//   * the `case` arms, which are what the script accepts;
//   * the refusal the `*)` arm prints, which names the same targets in prose
//     for a person whose machine is neither. The arms and the message drifting
//     apart is the ordinary way this file goes wrong, and it is caught here;
//   * README.md's "Getting it" section, which states the pair a reader is
//     shown, so the site restates the repository rather than one file of it;
//   * README.md's own platform words under the one-liner ("Linux x86-64 and
//     macOS arm64"), which is where the prose name beside each target comes
//     from. They are found by the fenced block that holds the `install.sh`
//     one-liner rather than by the clause that used to follow them, because
//     what follows is prose about other platforms and moves: 48bc8d0b5 put a
//     PowerShell block between the sentence and the clause this once matched.
//     What does not move is that the sentence sits directly under the command
//     it qualifies. Each phrase is matched back to a target by scoring the
//     target's own `uname` components against the phrase's words, so the only
//     spellings this file knows are the two aliases below. An unmatched or
//     ambiguous phrase fails and names itself; it is never guessed;
//   * install.ps1, which is the same three questions for the one platform
//     install.sh refuses. 0.14.0 is the first release to publish a Windows
//     build, and it is a zip rather than a tarball with an installer of its
//     own, so it is recorded beside the tarballs instead of among them: one
//     target, read out of the `$Asset` line that names it, cross-checked
//     against the refusal that script prints for a 32-bit Windows and against
//     the file name README.md spells out under "Getting it". Its prose name
//     is README.md's own ("Windows x86-64"), found by the target's own
//     components rather than assembled from them.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not check that a release actually published the
// tarballs, or that a URL resolves. It checks that the site offers exactly what
// the installer would fetch. A release that shipped one asset short while
// install.sh still accepted both would pass here and fail in the installer,
// which is the same place it fails for everyone else.
